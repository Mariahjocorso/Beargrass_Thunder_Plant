I created this project to fulfill the requirments for my Software Dev 1 Course with code Louisville. It is the begining of a product tracking application
that can hold my small buisnesses inventory. It will hold all of our seed and flower inventory in the future.  

Features
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
2. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent.
3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
4. Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file.

Requirements
Runs on Visual Studio 22
Window 10  (May run on Windows 11 but unsure)
